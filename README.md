About our work

we built a robot using ev3 motors powered by arduino mega, we used the huskylens camera to detect several things like walls and obstacles, we trained the lens to distinguish the obstacles from one to another but we ran into an issue, the colors of the obstacles that we 3d printed weren't matching the original colors of the obstacles so to avoid confusion occuring with the lens while doing the obstacle challenge we printed on Microsoft Word shapes that had the same dimensions of the obstacles but now with the right colors then we glued them to the actual 3d printed obstacles
